# Spare Food Share

This project aims to make sharing sparefood easy for various neighbourhoods in the UK. Users of the service would be able to list food items and their expiry dates while others would be able to indicate interest and collect the items in a safe location. The application shall make it easy to share food listings on social media sites and WhatsApp.

Project created as part of my MSc program in the University of Sheffield
